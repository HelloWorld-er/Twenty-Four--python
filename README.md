# Twenty-Four-Puzzle-in-Python

## Description
A classical mathematical game made by Python (includes tkinter)

## Intro (Game Rule)
The 24 Game is an arithmetical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24.

The game is played with a deck of 52 cards, each card has a number from 1 to 13, and four cards are drawn.

The game is played by rearranging the numbers and using the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to form an expression that equals 24.

## Set Up
1. **Install a Python Interpreter**: Install python interpreter in the [Python Official Website](https://python.org) if you do not have
2. **Navigate to the working directory**: open terminal and navigate to the working directory
3. **Create the Virtual Environment**: Use Python's `venv` module to create a virtual environment. You can name the environment anything you like, commonly `venv` or `env`
   ``` Shell
   python -m venv venv
   ```
5. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ``` Shell
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On Unix or MacOS:
     ``` Shell
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
6. **Install Requirements**: With the virtual environment activated, use `pip` to install all the necessary packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
   ``` Shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
7. **Deactivating the Virtual Environment**: Once you're done working, you can deactivate the virtual environment:
   ``` Shell
   deactivate
   ```
